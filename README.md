# Personal Portofolio Website

## Description
This is my personal portfolio website, created as part of the SPARTA 2023 Software Engineering career path assignment. The website is a single-page application with several sections. It has been deployed using Vercel, and you can view it directly at [Carlo Portofolio Website](https://carlo-portofolio-website.vercel.app/)

## Section
- **Home**: Contains my name, a profile picture, links to my social media, and my CV.
- **About**: Contains a brief overview of who I am, my interests and hobbies, my educational background, and the tech stack and tools I have experience with.
- **Projects**: Lists the projects that have been completed, along with brief descriptions of each.
- **Achievements**: Showcases the accomplishments achieved.
- **Contact**: Contains my contact information such as email, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp.

## Framework and Tools Used
- **Next.js**:  A react framework for building full-stack web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly designing custom user interfaces.
